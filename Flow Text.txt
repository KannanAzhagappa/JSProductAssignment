Thought process from a user presepctive:

1) Open the product catalog from the main portfolio page
2) The product catalog page will be shown
3) The user will be shown a drop down with all the products available for sales (This is populated by JSON file from backend)
4) Once the user selects the product, we will have four sections to choose from:
 - Product Details
 - Product Category
 - Pricing Info
 - Buy Options (If applicable)
5) For Product details, It is a information view about the product and its price in base currency (SGD)
6) For product category, it shows the user how the description of the product varies based on their selection of the product from the dropdown
7) For Pricing Info, the user will have a currency conversion option (54 currencies to choose from) and once selected, a new information with the converted price & the corresponding rate shown.
The user will have a option to change other currencies or can also reset the selected currency by clicking on reset button. Upon reset, only selection option for conversion will be available.
8) Once the user have selected the currency conversions, the user can choose to show interest in purchase. Upon clicking the button, the thank message will be shown 
This is only applicable for products which are available for sales (The buy button will be enabled).
For products which are not available for sales, the buy button will be disabled with a disclaimer text.
9) In addition to this, the user can resize the screen and change view from horizontal section selection to vertical section selection.
And please note that there will be an alert message displayed at too small screens.
